	<div class="column1of3">
		<p>Today is a continuation of the PreWork section that I started yesterday. Today I'll be making a page that uses CSS to arrange its contents into three columns. I will also be using CSS to make an image gallery using floats. I hope this does not mean that I have not been supposed to use floats for all of these, because that's what I've been doing.</p>
		<p>Now, for the page you are currently looking at I will basically be using the same css layout style that I did for the page that I made yesterday, with a few changes to the content, obviously. So again, I set up my html and css pages with the typical framework and link to one another. Today, instead of putting two columns in the body of my page I put 3, simply using the div class="column1of3" method that I used yesterday. I made each column the same dimensions with float: left, width: 300px, and margin: 10px. Then hit that save. Always Save.</p>
		<p>Again, I am not sure if this is exactly what I am supposed to be doing, but it seems to be working so I'm going with it.</p>

		<p>Okay I'm back at it. I changed the date for this column because it's a different day now. Today I changed the CSS a bit by adding a border and padding to each column and changing the width and margin of each column. I guess I mostly just did all that to play around with it a little and see how I could change it. I've done some work like this with CSS before but it's been a little while so I'm just kind of brushing up on it and trying to remember sytax and details and whatnot. Very entertaining for you to read about, I'm SURE. </p>
		<p>The next portion of this CSS assignment will be more interesting, at least for me. I will be making an image gallery using pictures of tropical islands! I absolutely love being anywhere tropical and have every intention of living on an island and exploring and SCUBA diving on a daily basis. People always have the nerve to tell me "Oh you don't want to do that, you don't want to LIVE there." Well, I say to them, "No. No, YOU don't want to live there. Don't tell me what I want and don't want. Fool." (Seriously, that's how I'm going to start responding from now on when people say that sort of nonsense to me.)  My heart belongs to the Sea and I belong on an island. Truly I do, and that's that. But now for more coding... because real life. But I'm not kidding about living on an island someday. Hopefully sooner than later.</p>

	<div class="column3of3">
		<p>So.... no date for this column because I've just moved on from filling in the middle column. I tried to do a few things to make this page look less plain, but obviously I only took it so far. I'm going to go ahead a write about the third part of this assignment which is using floats to make an image gallery. I'm going to go work on it and report back here as soon as I'm done.</p>
		<p>I've made my image gallery and while the pictures are just beautiful, they are not "floating" very nicely together and I am not sure what to do about that. I can't really get them to fit together all tetris-y like, as I want them to. But I did manage to get them to fit together slightly better than they had been but only by switching some of the images' places in the html file. I don't really think that counts. I clearly have much to learn on this subject, but I think I will move on from it for now because I'm getting frustrated with it.</p>
		<p>I struggled several times because I kept forgetting that blasted save. So I made sure to hit save at the end. ALWAYS SAVE!</p>
